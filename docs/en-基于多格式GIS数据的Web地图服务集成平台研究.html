<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-research-background">1.1 Research Background</h3>
<p>With the rapid development of geographic information technology and the continuous expansion of application fields, WebGIS platforms have become important tools for geospatial data management and visualization. Traditional WebGIS platforms face numerous challenges in handling multiple data formats, maintaining data style integrity, and providing high-performance services. Particularly when processing CAD format data (such as DXF files), existing solutions often fail to effectively preserve key information such as layer structure, color configuration, and line type styles from the original design intent[1,2].</p>
<p>Current mainstream map service architectures primarily rely on OGC standards such as WMS (Web Map Service), WFS (Web Feature Service), and WMTS (Web Map Tile Service). While these perform well in standardization and interoperability, they have obvious deficiencies in large-scale data processing and real-time interactive performance[7,9]. Emerging vector tile technology (Vector Tiles) provides new approaches to solving these problems, but how to achieve efficient vector tile services while ensuring data integrity remains a technical challenge[3,12].</p>
<p>Front-end map display faces numerous challenges in traditional architectures, including slow loading speeds, excessive network requests, and enormous back-end server pressure. These problems are particularly prominent on mobile devices and in weak network environments, seriously affecting user experience and system availability. To address these issues, this research proposes IndexDB-based intelligent caching strategies and deep learning prediction algorithms, effectively improving front-end map loading performance and user interaction experience.</p>
<h3 id="12-research-status">1.2 Research Status</h3>
<p><img alt="Traditional WebGIS Architecture vs. This Research Architecture Comparison" src="images-svg-en/traditional-vs-modern-webgis.svg" />
Figure 1-1: Traditional WebGIS Architecture vs. This Research Architecture Comparison</p>
<p>In recent years, scholars have conducted extensive research on WebGIS performance optimization, multi-format data processing, and style preservation. Chen Pixiang[6] proposed a system architecture based on GPU parallel computing and WebGIS, significantly improving the processing performance of large-scale geographic data; Shi Shanzhong[2] studied lossless conversion methods from CAD to GIS data using FME, achieving important progress in style information preservation; Wang Shaoping[7] designed a high-concurrency WebGIS system based on cloud platforms, improving map service response performance to a certain extent.</p>
<p>However, existing research mostly focuses on optimization of single technical aspects, lacking comprehensive consideration of multi-format data processing, style preservation, and service performance. Particularly in building integrated platforms that support multiple coordinate systems, multiple data formats, and have high-concurrency processing capabilities, systematic solutions are still lacking.</p>
<h3 id="13-research-objectives-and-contributions">1.3 Research Objectives and Contributions</h3>
<p>This research aims to design and implement a high-performance Web map service integration platform supporting multi-format GIS data. The main research objectives include:</p>
<ol>

<li>Developing intelligent extraction and preservation algorithms for DXF style information to maximize retention of original design intent</li>
<li>Designing a dual-track service publishing mechanism to achieve complementary advantages of WMS and MVT services</li>

<p>This research adopts a microservice architecture design, dividing the entire platform into four main layers: data ingestion layer, service processing layer, cache optimization layer, and front-end presentation layer. The system architecture features high cohesion and low coupling, supporting horizontal scaling and modular deployment.</p>
<h4 id="211-data-ingestion-layer">2.1.1 Data Ingestion Layer</h4>
<p>The data ingestion layer is responsible for handling upload, validation, and preprocessing of multiple geographic data formats. This layer adopts a unified file processing interface, automatically determining data types through format recognition algorithms and invoking corresponding data processing modules.</p>
<p>The system supports various mainstream geographic data formats, including vector data (SHP, DXF, GeoJSON, KML), raster data (GeoTIFF, PNG, JPEG), and tile data (MBTiles, PMTiles). Each data type has corresponding processing strategies: vector data is parsed and converted through GDAL/OGR libraries, then based on data characteristics, either published as WMS services through GeoServer or as MVT services through Martin.</p>
<h4 id="212-service-processing-layer">2.1.2 Service Processing Layer</h4>
<p>The service processing layer implements a dual-track service publishing architecture, supporting both traditional GeoServer WMS services and modern Martin MVT services simultaneously.

</ol>
<h4 id="222-service-publishing-module">2.2.2 Service Publishing Module</h4>
<p>The service publishing module implements two different approaches for automatic service publishing: GeoServer RESTful API publishing service and Martin publishing service. GeoServer publishing adopts traditional enterprise-level GIS service architecture, automatically creating workspaces, data stores, and layers through REST API, supporting WMS/WFS service publishing for multiple formats including Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, etc. The system implements complete publishing workflow management, including data validation, coordinate system conversion, style configuration, and service registration. Martin publishing adopts modern vector tile technology, automatically generating MVT services after importing vector data into PostGIS database, achieving high-performance tile service publishing through unified table naming rules (vector_ prefix) and automatic index creation. The two publishing approaches are complementary: GeoServer provides standardized OGC services and rich style support, suitable for traditional GIS applications; Martin provides lightweight vector tile services supporting client-side dynamic rendering, with significant performance advantages in large data volume and high-concurrency scenarios. The system automatically selects the most suitable publishing approach based on data characteristics and application requirements through intelligent routing mechanisms.</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="412-core-algorithm-implementation">4.1.2 Core Algorithm Implementation</h4>
